## Introduction
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a crucial task in many applications, such as digitizing printed documents, CAPTCHA solving, and automated data extraction. This project fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM for the specific task of OCR using a Kaggle dataset of CAPTCHA images.
- By leveraging pre-trained LLM(trocr-small-printed) , I fine-tune it on custom dataset
## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the CAPTCHA images dataset and can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images
## Results
The fine-tuned model achieves the following results on the CAPTCHA dataset:
- Character Error Rate (CER): 0.01
