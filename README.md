# OCR-using-Fine-Tuning-LLM-on-custom-datatset
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a crucial task in many applications, such as digitizing printed documents, CAPTCHA solving, and automated data extraction. This project fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM for the specific task of OCR using a Kaggle dataset of CAPTCHA images.
By leveraging pre-trained LLM(trocr-small-printed) , I fine-tune it on custom dataset
